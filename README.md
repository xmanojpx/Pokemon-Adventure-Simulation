# Pokemon Adventure Simulation 🎮

A console-based game simulating a Pokemon trainer's journey to catch or battle shapes across 10 levels. Developed as part of the B.Tech program in Computer Science Engineering with AI/ML at SRM Institute of Science and Technology.


## Features ✨
- **10 Levels**: Progress through 10 levels, each with a randomly generated shape (Triangle, Rectangle, Circle).
- **Catch Mechanics**: 50% chance to catch encountered shapes.
- **Battle System**: *Planned feature (not yet implemented)*.
- **UML Diagrams**: Includes Use Case, Class, Sequence, and other diagrams for design clarity.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Utilizes C++ classes and inheritance for shapes.

## Installation 🛠️
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pokemon-adventure-simulation.git
Compile the Code:

Ensure you have a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).

Navigate to the project directory and compile:

bash
Copy
g++ main.cpp -o pokemon_game
Run the Game:

bash
Copy
./pokemon_game
Usage 🕹️
Start the game and choose y to begin.

At each level, encounter a random shape.

Choose to Catch (50% success chance) or Battle (placeholder logic).

Complete all 10 levels to win!

Example Output:

Copy
Level 1 - You have encountered a Rectangle!
What do you want to do? (1) Catch it (2) Battle it
1
You throw a Pokeball at the Rectangle...
The Rectangle has been caught!
Documentation 📄
UML Diagrams: Descriptions and diagrams (Use Case, Class, Sequence, etc.) are included in the project report.

Project Report: See Document_28_merged.pdf for full details on design, modules, and conclusions.

Future Improvements 🚀
Implement battle logic with type-based strengths/weaknesses.

Add Pokemon classes with attributes (HP, attacks).

Improve UI with ASCII art or color.

Refactor code for modularity and readability.
